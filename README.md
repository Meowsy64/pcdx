# PCDX

This is a mod for the PC port of Perfect Dark that adds new features, mostly focusing on new cheats. This is *not* based on the netplay branch of the PC port, and does not support netplay.

To run the port, you must already have a Perfect Dark ROM, specifically `ntsc-final`/`US V1.1`/`US Rev 1` (md5 `e03b088b6ac9e0080440efed07c1e40f`).

The NTSC v1.0, PAL, and Japanese ROMs are *not* supported.
